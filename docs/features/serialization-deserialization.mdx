title: ' Serialization/Deserialization '
--- 

## Introduction 

Serialization allows users to save configurations of bot instances 
across different user sessions. Deserialization allows users to input
serialized configurations of bots, allowing the bot instances to be initialized
from the state that it was serialized in. This allows the user to save
computational resources and provides a way to utilize different configurations.

## Usage

**Serialization**: Bot instances can be serialized using the `serialize()` function. 
This function is part of the bot instance and preserves a bots state. It allows the 
bot instance to convert itself into a JSON-formatted string. 
Since serialization is placed as a decorator for classes. The bot instance can
access the function like so: 

`serialized_bot =
bot_instace.serialize()`.

The serialized bot will be represented in JSON and can be saved.


**Deserialization:** Bot instances that were serialized can be deserialized utilizing 
the `deserialize(json)` function. This loads back the same bot instance using the JSON-string
that was returned by the`serialize()` function. Utilziing this is as follows:

`app = App.deserialize(json_string)`

If deserializing fails, the function returns a default instance.
